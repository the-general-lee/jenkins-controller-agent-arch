# jenkins-controller-agent-arch
This project is a demonstration of a Jenkins Controller-Agent Architecture configured with two agent nodes:

Node 1: Dedicated to building a Node.js application.
Node 2: Dedicated to building an Angular application.
The setup illustrates the division of tasks in a Jenkins environment, showcasing how different builds can be executed on separate agents for better scalability and resource management.

This example is ideal for understanding distributed build architectures and integrating Jenkins into CI/CD pipelines for modern web applications.
